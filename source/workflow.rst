App Development Workflow
########################

The core of Caktus’ workflow is constant client interaction, showing progress
via continuous deployment, and iteration based on feedback. This document
outlines Caktus’ ideal workflow evolution to ensure common practices are shared
across the team (and to inform new team members). These are provided as defaults
and may be adjusted for specific team and project configurations.

At a high level, we focus on:

* **Rapid Prototyping and App Design:** User experience and visual conditions are established using an iterative and phased approach, shifting to coded client demos early on and allowing for ongoing development team integration.
* **Collective Code Ownership, Unit Testing, Code Reviews:** These practices ensure shared knowledge of what is being done, verify correct functioning of all code, and the code is following community and team-established standards.
