<span id="aws"></span><h1>Amazon Web Services (AWS)<a class="headerlink" href="#amazon-web-services-aws" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>We often deploy to Amazon Web Services. Here are some tips on getting started.</p>
<div class="section" id="aws-accounts-vs-iam-users">
<h2>AWS Accounts vs. IAM Users<a class="headerlink" href="#aws-accounts-vs-iam-users" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>With AWS, we need to be careful to distinguish <em>AWS accounts</em> from <em>IAM users</em>.</p>
<p><em>AWS Accounts</em> are connected to billing, and to visibility and access to resources.
Caktus has an AWS account. Some of our clients have their own AWS accounts that
we might use when working for those clients, so that they get billed
directly for the resources used instead of us.</p>
<p><em>IAM Users</em> are created within accounts to let administrators
“log into” those accounts and access those resources. IAM Users within
one account are unrelated to IAM users in any other account. If I have
IAM users named “johndoe” in two different AWS accounts, they are completely
separate and different, having nothing to do with each other.</p>
<p>For you to do things in the Caktus AWS account, someone
will have to create an <em>IAM user</em> for you within that AWS account, and give it the
privileges for what you need to do.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="root-users-vs-iam-users">
<h2>Root users vs. IAM users<a class="headerlink" href="#root-users-vs-iam-users" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Just to confuse things, <em>AWS accounts</em> each have a <em>root user</em>, which is not
an IAM user within that AWS account, but a user in the global Amazon system of
users - the same set of users that can buy things on Amazon’s shopping
sites, in fact. To create a new AWS account, you have to log in as one of
this type of user.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="logging-in">
<h2>Logging in<a class="headerlink" href="#logging-in" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To login using a <em>root user</em>, start at
<a class="reference external" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com">https://console.aws.amazon.com</a>.
If you find you’re already logged in, log out and go to that page
again. Then click the link below the login form - it currently says
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Sign-in</span> <span class="pre">using</span> <span class="pre">root</span> <span class="pre">account</span> <span class="pre">credentials</span></code>.</p>
<p>You can tell you’re logging in as one of these type of users
because the login page will only prompt for a username and
password.</p>
<p>To login using an <em>IAM user</em> in a particular account, you need to go to another page.
These login pages prompt for <em>three</em> things: <em>account</em>, username,
and password, so you can tell them apart from the “root” user
login page.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, finding a page to login as an <em>IAM user</em> can
be tricky. The simplest way is this: each AWS account has
a unique URL that will let you login to that AWS account.
Anyone who is already logged in as an <em>IAM user</em> on the account
can find the URL (I think) by going to the
<a class="reference external" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home">main *IAM* page</a>
in the AWS console.  Near the top they should see something
like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">IAM</span> <span class="n">users</span> <span class="n">sign</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">link</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="n">https</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="n">caktus</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">signin</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">aws</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">amazon</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">com</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">console</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Bookmarking that link will let you sign into that AWS account
using an IAM user. When you follow that link, you <em>will</em> be
redirected, and the resulting URL does <em>not</em> work directly
to log you into that account, so you cannot just find the signin page once and
bookmark it, you have to track down that original URL.</p>
<p>Anyway, using that link will take you to a three-field login
page with the <em>Account</em> field already correctly filled in.
Add the username and password and you will find yourself
logged into the AWS console.</p>
<p>If you know the account identifier, you can change the
account field on this login page to login to another
account, but not all account identifiers are as memorable
as “caktus”, some are just long random strings of numbers,
so bookmarking the canonical login URL seems easiest.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="subaccounts">
<h2>Subaccounts<a class="headerlink" href="#subaccounts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If that wasn’t complicated enough, if you need to work in an AWS
<em>subaccount</em>, there are more steps.</p>
<p>Hopefully someone has given you a link to use for accessing
the subaccount. That link will not let you log in directly,
though. First you need to login normally to the main account.
Only after you’ve done that can you use the link, which should
then switch you “into” that subaccount. While you’re switched,
you’ll only see resources of that subaccount, not of the parent
account.</p>
<p>You can confirm how you’re currently logged in by looking near
the top right in the console. When I’m logged in to the main
Caktus account, I see a dropdown “<a class="reference external" href="mailto:dpoirier&#37;&#52;&#48;caktus">dpoirier<span>&#64;</span>caktus</a>”. Once
I switch roles to a subaccount, I see only the display name
for the subaccount.  Clicking that dropdown displays full details
of how I’m logged in, along with a “back to dpoirier” link
to exit the subaccount and go back to the main account.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="aws-console">
<h2>AWS Console<a class="headerlink" href="#aws-console" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The AWS Console is the web interface to all the AWS services. It
can be overwhelming. Here are some tips for navigating around.</p>
<p>First - you need to know which AWS service you need to work with.
For example, suppose you need to create a new virtual machine.
That AWS service is called “EC2”. In the AWS console, click the
orange cube that appears in the top left of every page, and you’ll
end up at a directory of AWS services. It’s also overwhelming :-),
but if you don’t spot EC2 right away, you can search in the browser
page for it. When you find it, click it, and you’ll be in the part
of the AWS console where you can manage EC2.</p>
<p><em>Unfortunately</em>, not everything we think of as an AWS service
is listed on that directory page (believe it or not). For example, quite a few
services are managed within the EC2 part of the AWS console - such
as Security Groups, Elastic Load Balancers, Elastic IPs, Autoscaling
Groups, etc.  You can see them listed down the left side of the
EC2 interface.</p>
<p>So, if you don’t see the service you want on the main directory
of services, try within the EC2 part of the console.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="regions">
<h2>Regions<a class="headerlink" href="#regions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Another important concept to understand from the beginning
is the <em>AWS Region</em>. You can think of an AWS Region as a
geographic location where Amazon has a bunch of data
centers. There are regions with names like “US East (N. Virginia)”,
“EU (Ireland)”, “EU (Frankfurt)”, etc.</p>
<p>With most AWS services, you can create and use resources in
any region you like, but to manage them, you first have to
select one region using the dropdown near the top right of
every page. Once you’ve selected a region, you will only see
resources from that region, and new resources you create will
be created in that region, until you select a different region.</p>
<p>Tip: You can have multiple browser tabs/windows open
to the AWS console with different regions selected, if that
helps on really big projects to keep an eye on everything.
But usually you won’t have to do that.</p>
<p>We typically try to create resources in a region closest
to the majority of the site’s users. If we can’t pick a
region that way, we usually end up in “US East (N. Virginia)”
just because it seems to be the default.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">Not every service is available in every region.
Before you start setting up a great big infrastructure in some
region, it’s a good idea to verify that all the services
you will need are available there. You don’t want the
services that make up your site to have to communicate
between regions if you can help it.</p>
